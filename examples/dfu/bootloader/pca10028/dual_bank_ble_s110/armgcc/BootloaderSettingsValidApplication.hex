; Data: 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

; At the address 0x3FC00 the bootloader stores its information. The first byte (0x01) marks that a valid application exists. The following two bytes are the CRC
; the application is checked against to determine its validity. This hex-File writes these values to 0x00 which forces the bootloader to ignore the CRC check.
